                    <p class="card-text">The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
                        descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a
                        population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs were the first
                        species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due to
                        their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet
                        that would be inadequate for other canids.

                        Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog
                        breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the
                        exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of
                        smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and
                        hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
                        herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and
                        assisting police and the military.

                        Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture
                        (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and
                        taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a
                        new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this
                        adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the
                        human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has
                        given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

                        The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the
                        world. The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households.
                        Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of
                        dogs are estimated</p>
